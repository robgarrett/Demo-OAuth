The following commands run within the package manager console and allow creation of a local
database in the App_Data folder of the project.

The following command enables migrations and creates a configuration class in the migrations folder...

Enable-Migrations –EnableAutomaticMigrations

The configuration class contains a seed method, which we use to prepopulate data in our database.
Update this class to seed users with the ASP.NET User Manager:

var manager = new UserManager<OAuthUser>(new UserStore<OAuthUser>(new OAuthDbContext()));
manager.Create(new OAuthUser { UserName = "rgarrett"}, "Password");

Initialize the migration with the following command:

Add-Migration Init

You should now have an {Number}_Init.cs class, which initializes the ASP.NET table structure etc (scaffolding).
Now update the database, which will create a new MDF if if it doesn't already exist...

Update-Database
